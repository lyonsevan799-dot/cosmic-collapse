- Present one arena gameplay mode; preserve legacy save fields while recording arena achievements and lifetime statistics so old progress survives migration.
- Reuse the existing Canvas object physics for bots; arena helpers stay in src/game/arena.ts to keep AI rules testable without UI.
- Share frame-rate independent steering and growth rules between human and opponents so gameplay remains fair and tunable internally.
- Package standalone exports from a temporary Vite client entry that mounts the existing game, leaving TanStack Start routing and deployment unchanged.
